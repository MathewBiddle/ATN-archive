# Mapping ATN satellite telemetry template to Darwin Core
This page documents the Standard Operating Procedures for mapping the ATN observations into Darwin Core.
The observations have been split into [trajectory](#trajectory) and [profile](#profile) observation types.
Each section below documents the decisions made for the translation of the ATN netCDF data into DarwinCore.

## Trajectory
See this [R notebook](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/blob/main/datasets/atn_satellite_telemetry/atn_satellite_telemetry_netCDF2DwC.Rmd) on performing the translation.

## Profile
TBD
