# Mapping ATN template to Darwin Core
This page documents the Standard Operating Procedures for mapping the ATN observations into Darwin Core.
The observations have been split into [trajectory](#trajectory) and [profile](#profile) observation types.
Each section below documents the decisions made for the translation of the ATN netCDF data into DarwinCore.

## Trajectory
See this [R notebook](https://github.com/MathewBiddle/notebooks_demos/blob/r_nc2dwc/notebooks/DRAFT-R-netCDF2DwC.ipynb) on performing the translation.
